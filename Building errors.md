- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DarkWyrd
-While working on a new map I found two issues.
A: The inability to create rooms in smaller buildings due to gaps between the perimeter wall and the desired wall to be added. This wholey ruins the setting I am trying to design. They should be able to snap together regardless of the attach location being a perimeter wall end or not.
B: Rural thatch roof tiles will not attach correctly, they are either reded out as a sign of incompatability or they will float off and cease existance until I reenter the map when they will be attached in the attempted location which as yet to be the correct location.
